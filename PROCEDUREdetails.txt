Procedure to make NEW RPi SD Card Image
=======================================
{This is a semi-automated system using the latest standard OS from Raspberry Pi which is modified for FabMo with a script that is run on a RPi.}

A. ##### MAKE the Working-OS-Image
** REPLACE 1 and 2 by doing the imaging on the Pi?? **
** Check out the new "sdm" system to improve this system and potentially get smaller zipped image for shipping **
1. Download image from Raspi Foundation Current 64bit Full Image PC and save to a build folder.
2. Use this image to create an initial SD-card using Balena Etcher.
3. Run this card once on a Raspberry Pi:
	- hook up a keyboard/mouse and follow the start-up sequence .... {{details}}
	- this takes a while because it brings in all the latest updates
4. Shut down the RPi, remove this card, and Bring it card back to PC.
5. Use Win32Disk Imager to make the new "Working-OS-Image" SAVE THIS a MASTER FOR UPDATES for x Months !

B. ##### MAKE the FabMo-RPi-Image
6. Copy this "Working-OS-Image" to an SD-card again with Balena Etcher. THIS now the SD card FOR our WORKING-BUILD !
7. Boot up for making the WORKING-BUILD on a Raspberry Pi:
8. THEN DO:
    sudo mkdir /home/pi/Scripts
    [copy into this new folder (you can use WinSCP logged on as pi)]:
      	build-fabmo-image.sh
	    resources [folder]
9. RUN: 
	cd /home/pi/Scripts  
	sudo ./build-fabmo-image.sh


10. WHEN this is finished running, check to make sure things got installed and permissions look right.
10. Reboot this card. Hopefully everything comes up looking as it should?
11. This SD card can now be used with the Win32Disk Imager to make our NEW FabMo-RPi-Image
      	(it can also be copied from this RPi for quick copies).
        [to manage size of the ultimate zipped imaged file ...]
