Procedure to make NEW RPi SD Card Image
=======================================
{This is a semi-automated system using the latest standard OS from Raspberry Pi which is modified for FabMo with a script that is run on a RPi.}

** REPLACE 1 and 2 by doing the imaging on the Pi?? **
** Check out the new "sdm" system to improve this system and potentially get smaller zipped image for shipping **
1. Download image from Raspi Foundation Current 64bit Full Image PC and save to a build folder.
2. Use this image to create an initial SD-card using Balena Etcher.
3. Run this card once on a Raspberry Pi:
	- hook up a keyboard/mouse and follow the start-up sequence .... {{details}}
	- this takes a while because it brings in all the latest updates
4. Shut down RPi and Bring this card back to PC and use Win32Disk Imager to make the "working-Image" SAVE THIS a MASTER FOR UPDATES for x Months !
5. Copy this "working-Image" to an SD-card again with Balena Etcher  THIS SD IS FOR our WORKING-BUILD !
6. Boot up for making this WORKING-BUILD on a Raspberry Pi:
7.      sudo mkdir /home/pi/Scripts
8.      copy into this new folder (you can use WinSCP logged on as pi):
          	build-fabmo-image.sh
		resources [folder]
9. RUN: 
	cd /home/pi/Scripts  
	sudo ./build-fabmo-image.sh

10. WHEN this is finished running, reboot this card. OK?
11. This SD card can now be used with the Win32Disk Imager to make our NEW FabMo RPi IMAGE
      	(it can also be copied on the RPi for local copies).
